YourProjectName is a **JavaScript library for building user interfaces**.

## ✨ Features

- **Declarative:** Makes it simple to build interactive UIs.  
  Design views for each state, and automatically update when data changes.

- **Component-Based:** Build encapsulated components that manage their own state,  
  and compose them to make complex UIs.

- **Learn Once, Write Anywhere:** Works across web and native with tools like [React Native](https://reactnative.dev).

React has been designed for gradual adoption from the start —  
you can use as little or as much as you need.
